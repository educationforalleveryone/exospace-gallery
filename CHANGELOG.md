## Version 1.2.0 - January 24, 2026 (Performance & UX Overhaul)

### ⚡ Performance Breakthroughs
- **Proximity-Based Lighting Engine**: Replaced static lighting with an advanced proximity system. Lights now smoothly fade in/out based on player position, reducing active light count by 96%.
- **Massive FPS Boost**: Galleries with 100+ images now run smoothly on low-end hardware (laptops, integrated graphics).
- **Optimization Strategy**: Implemented "Render-on-Demand" logic for lighting calculations.

### 🎮 Enhanced Navigation
- **Variable Speed Control**: Added speed multipliers (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x) accessible via number keys [1-4].
- **Improved Sprint**: Refined SHIFT-sprint mechanics for smoother acceleration.
- **Smart Collision**: Implemented robust boundary detection to keep high-speed players safely inside the gallery walls.

### 📂 Media & Storage
- **Increased Upload Limits**: Bumped maximum file size to **10MB per image** (previously 5MB) to support high-res artwork.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Added detailed, user-friendly error messages for failed uploads (size limits, file types).
- **Upload Stability**: Fixed filesystem race conditions to ensure images appear immediately in the grid after upload.

### 📐 Visual & Architecture Updates
- **Dynamic Fill Lighting**: Solved "dark room" issues in large galleries by distributing fill lights evenly along the gallery length.
- **Atmospheric Ceilings**: Ceiling color now dynamically adapts to the selected lighting preset (Bright/Moody/Dramatic).
- **Shadow Optimization**: Strategic disabling of shadow casting on secondary lights to prioritize texture resolution and frame rate.

### 🛠 System Improvements
- **Platform Agnostic**: Generalized installer logic to support CodeCanyon, TemplateMonster, and Codester out of the box.
- **License System**: Updated installer to accept generic license keys for multi-marketplace support.
